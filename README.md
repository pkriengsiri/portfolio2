Portfolio for Pete Kriengsiri

## Description

This application is a single-page weather dashboard.  It was created using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap CSS Framework, JavaScript, jQuery, and the font-awesome icon pack.  The application uses jQuery AJAX calls to the Open Weather API to obtain weather and UV information.  This dashboard allows the user to input a desired city, and will present the user with current weather conditions as well as a five day forecast.

### Features
* Current weather conditions and five day forecast for a user selected city 
* UV index, with color coding based upon the severity of the exposure as defined by the US EPA
* User searches are saved in localStorage for up to the last 10 cities searched
* When the user reopens the application, it will display the last city searched in addition to a listing of previous cities searched
* Clicking on a previous search button will redisplay the current weather and forecast for that city
* The application will provide a warning to the user if the city entered into the search field does not match a city in the Open Weather API database

## Installation

## Usage
Upon accessing the application for the first time, the user will only be presented with a search field where they can enter their desired city.  After the first search, current weather, 5 day forecast, and a listing of previous searches will appear.  Previous cities searched will be stored in localStorage and will be recalled the next time the user accesses the application.
